Maintenance Tips for Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting Systems

1. Clean the Roof and Gutters Regularly
- Remove leaves, dust, and debris from the rooftop and gutters to prevent blockages.
- Clean before and after the monsoon season.

2. Inspect Recharge Structures
- Periodically check the recharge pit, trench, or shaft for silt accumulation.
- Remove accumulated silt to maintain proper infiltration.

3. Check Inlet and Outlet Pipes
- Make sure that the inlet and outlet pipes are not blocked or damaged.
- Repair any leaks or cracks immediately.

4. Avoid Contaminants
- Do not allow wastewater, oils, or chemicals to enter the rainwater harvesting system.
- Ensure only clean rainwater flows into the recharge structure.

5. Monitor Water Levels
- Keep track of groundwater level trends if possible.
- Ensure the system is functioning properly by observing water percolation rates.

6. Periodic Professional Checkup
- Once a year, get a professional hydrologist or technician to inspect the system and suggest improvements.

Following these simple maintenance steps will ensure long-term efficiency and sustainability of your rainwater harvesting system.
